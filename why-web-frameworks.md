Let's recap that in writing. First and foremost: _The web is a mess_. You'll want to use a web framework because it _simplifies web development_. More specifically, it helps you to:

- **Automate** repetitive web development tasks
- **Abstract** database interactions
- **Handle** URL requests and URL mapping
- **Provide** templating frameworks
- **Help** with security, caching, sessions, etc.

In this post you learned about what web frameworks are and why they are useful for web development. In the next post, you will learn about why _Django_ is a great choice for a Python web framework.
