Digital nomads, by definition, love the freedom to work from anywhere. But what if you don’t yet have the skills to secure remote work? What if you desire more technical knowledge that goes beyond online jobs like affiliate marketing or customer service? Perhaps you’re looking for more of a challenge. Perhaps you want to build a career rather than just a job.

For aspiring digital nomads who love to travel, and want to learn technical skills that can secure work anywhere, <a href="https://codingnomads.co/">CodingNomads</a> was founded to help people do both. We take students on epic international trips and teach intensive software development courses, also known as coding bootcamps.

Our upcoming March – May 2017 course is 8 weeks in Bali followed by 4 weeks online, so students can really experience living like a digital nomad alongside a like-minded cohort. In Bali, students learn to code in paradise at a beautiful jungle co-working space with two pools, free massages and riverside nature trails. We are also planning courses in Europe and the Americas to span the globe and adventure appetites. Who ever said learning to code has to be boring?

<h2>Learn the skills to pay the bills, without breaking the bank</h2>

International coding bootcamps give students a chance to take a break from normal routines and distractions in order to learn technical information fast. We specialize in teaching Java, SQL and AWS, which year-after-year remain among the most relevant and useful skills in the industry, but few bootcamps teach them. Java is a fundamental programming language used in countless applications across nearly every industry. We know from experience that once you know Java, you’ll be equipped to tackle engineering problems and even learn new languages like never before. We also teach students how and where to look for jobs online, resume writing, and how to prepare for interviews so students are ready to embark on a digital nomad career.

To make these skills accessible, we offer several bootcamp scholarships and inclusive packages that cover accommodation, airport pickup and more – all for the same price or less than most US bootcamps. We do this because both coding and international travel have changed our lives for the better, and we want to share the love. We are passionate about helping people improve their skills to improve their lives, and we’re passionate about travel. Through combining the two we are fueling the “destination education” industry for people who want to get the most out of their education, and the most out of their travel.

<h2>Do you have what it takes to be a CodingNomad?</h2>

Just like any digital nomad job, learning to code and securing work as a software developer requires determination, discipline and hard work. Like most careers, you may have to start with an internship or gigs that are over your head, and under your desired income. You’ll need to build your portfolio and experience with anything you can get your hands on, even if it means working for free or doing side projects with friends. No matter how talented or experienced you are, learning never ends for an engineer. Even coding savants like Mark Zuckerberg and people who get university computer science degrees put some time in the trenches before securing six-figure salaries. We did, and so will you.

But unlike most other jobs in the world, within just a few years you CAN achieve incredible salaries, job security and geographic flexibility as a software developer. And with the ever-increasing global demand for developers, you can do so without a university degree. CodingNomads’ Java bootcamp will be hard work. It will provide the tools and foundation for you to continue learning on your own for the rest of your career. The final four online weeks of our course particularly mirror the day-to-day tasks of a developer, giving students invaluable experience and preparation for professional software development work.

While we respect life-work balance just as much as anyone (we are, after all, combining coding bootcamps with international travel!), we also know that the students who will succeed in this course are those who understand the challenges, and approach them head-on. We want to be as transparent as possible about setting expectations with our students, and have published a list of considerations on our website for all applicants to read. If you are passionate about travel and ready for the challenge of becoming a software engineer, you already have what it takes to change your life, and join the adventure on our international coding bootcamps.

<h2>Freedom to work from anywhere is yours for the taking!</h2>

Some digital nomads love working remote to explore new destinations around the world. Many just want to work from the comfort of home. Learning technical skills like Java opens the door for you to decide, as Java skills are in demand everywhere. All you need is a computer, wifi, and the determination to get the job done. So what are you waiting for? Get in the driver’s seat of your career, and live the life you’ve been dreaming of.
