<h3>I took the leap. So can you.</h3>
Six years ago I quit my corporate job to jump into the world of freelance Android Development. At the time, I had no formal Android training, and no experience building apps for anyone other than myself. However what I learned from making that leap: it’s not as hard as you may think.

Demand for mobile app development skills in Android and iOs is high. Demand for quality developers is even higher. Of course you’ll have to start small and take the gigs you can get. But once you get a few projects under your belt, you’ll have ample opportunities for work as a mobile developer. Here are 6 tips for landing freelance mobile development gigs.
<h2>1. Launch your own apps on the Play Store / App Store</h2>
The reason for this is twofold:
<h3>Demonstrate experience</h3>
If you’ve just learned how to develop mobile apps, you don’t have any professional work experience yet for your resume/LinkedIn. Having your own apps on the Play Store and/or App store demonstrates that you have relevant experience for a job, and provides valuable stuff for your resume/social media.
<h3>Demonstrate excitement</h3>
Most companies, especially startups, like to see that you’re enthusiastic about Android / iOs app development outside of the job. They also want to see that you keep up to date with latest app development trends. Having your own apps on the Google Play / App Store provides a good indication of both.
<h3>You don’t need to build the Mona Lisa</h3>
In my experience, your app doesn’t have to be grand. It doesn’t even need many users or reviews. Oftentimes HR managers / recruiters just “check the box” that you have apps on the Play Store.

That said, I’d highly recommend releasing apps that provide use to some subset of mobile users. A “Hello World” app has amateur written all over it. Ultimately you’ll still have to show the dev team you’ve got the skills to do the job, so put your skills to work!
<h2>2. Your Resume (CV)</h2>
Just like any other job, applying for freelance roles requires an up-to-date resume. To be blunt: oftentimes your resume doesn’t even get read, just scanned for keywords. Employers want to know if you can do the job. Therefore your resume should scream “I can do this job.” Here’s how to convey this plain and simple:
<h3>List your relevant skills and achievements</h3>
A few short bullet points like: You have x amount of apps on the Play Store, experience working with X, Y &amp; Z SDK’s, experience programming in both Java &amp; Kotlin, familiar with SQL, etc.
<h3>List your relevant work experience</h3>
If you don’t have mobile app professional experience, list your own apps as work experience. Remember, it’s all about showing that you can do the job, so these count just as highly as professional experience.

If you do have professional experience, I’d suggest you break it down into projects. For example: you worked on Project A for company X from dates Y to Z. This helps highlight your exposure to various technologies, making your resume more robust.
<h3>Get those keywords in, make it shine</h3>
For each work experience item, provide bullet points (not paragraphs) of the notable technologies used, anything interesting / unique about the project, and any notable experience you gained such as working with an SDK, etc. Remember: keywords.
<h3>Secondary resume info</h3>
After this you can add previous unrelated work experience, hobbies or whatever else to make you look like a well-rounded person people want to work with. Just remember that this is second priority after all the above.
<h2>3. Update your LinkedIn &amp; AngelList</h2>
<h3>Keep it simple: Copy your CV</h3>
I personally advocate that your LinkedIn profile mirror your CV exactly, and link to companies you’ve worked with before. That also makes it less daunting to fill out, if LinkedIn isn’t “your thing.” A lot of CodingNomads students feel that way about LinkedIn and AngelList. But many of our students also found jobs through these sites. So they really can help, and it really doesn’t take too much time.
<h3>Be searchable</h3>
Recruiters search LinkedIn for candidates based on profile keywords. List all the technologies you’ve worked with, and ask your network to endorse you for those technologies.

Put your title as “Freelance mobile developer - seeking opportunities” so that people can find you by title, and see you’re looking for work. Let your network and recruiters know you’re available for work by sending public status updates, and turning on your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/career-interests/?trk=li_corpblog_opencandidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Open Candidate"</a> toggle.
<h2>4. Upload your CV to every job site you can</h2>
I’ll be honest: I’ve never heard back for a role I’ve applied for on a job board. I don’t apply for job board jobs to get that gig. I do it because when I apply, my CV is uploaded to the job board’s database. Now every recruiter with access to their database has just seen my CV pop up, and knows I’m available for work. Because my CV is now stacked with projects, my phone starts ringing almost immediately.

Try it - go on a job board, find any Android contract role, apply for it by uploading your CV, and you should soon hear from recruiters offering to help you find your next gig. Then find another job board and do it again. Obviously the more experience, projects and technologies (keywords!) that you have listed, the more “boxes you’ll check,” and the more recruiters you’ll hear from.
<h2>5. Network</h2>
Tapping into your existing network plus expanding your network can definitely increase your opportunities.
<h3>Existing Network</h3>
For your family, friends, and professional contacts - write up a quick message that highlights your motivations, skills, and the type of work you seek. Send it to your network, and ask them to pass it along too. Your mobile development skills are in high demand, and you never know who is looking for the skills you have to offer.
<h3>How to Build your Network</h3>
Attend local meetups, join a hackathon, or volunteer at a tech event to meet other people in the field - in person or online. The more people you talk to, the more contacts, ideas and avenues to explore will open up. You can also learn what people are looking for, and if you should study up on certain skills to be a more appealing recruit.

Reach out to people on LinkedIn and AngelList who work for the company you want to work for. Send them the quick message you drafted above. Demonstrate interest in their company/product, and ask if they are hiring. Ask them if they’ll intro you to the appropriate person. And follow up. You’re offering a valuable service, and the squeaky wheel oftentimes lands the job!
<h2>6. Take what you can, but don’t sell yourself short</h2>
If you’re just starting out on the mobile app developer freelance road, at first you’ll need to take what you can get. It might not be a project you’re interested in, it might not be an ideal location, it might not be ideal pay. But it is a foot in the door, and once you have one gig under your belt it’s wayyyyy easier to get the next one.

All that being said, don’t undercut the market when it comes to your compensation. You have the skills required for the job, or you wouldn’t be close to getting the gig. Don’t let someone value you less than the market rate for an entry-level developer, because you don’t have any “official” experience building apps. If you can do the job, you should get paid the same as anyone else who can do the job.
<h2>What about working remotely?</h2>
Ahhh the dream.. If you’re just getting started however, I will be completely honest with you: you usually need the experience—and therefore the proof—that leaving you to your own devices will produce the end product your client desires.

Once you have the experience, it’s then a case of finding clients who are willing to let you work remotely. In my experience, most companies <em>want</em> rather than <em>need</em> you to be on site. However it never hurts to ask if the gig can be done remotely, or part-time remote. In the meantime, get crazy good at your skill, and you’ll have a lot more leverage to take your skills remote.

There are places you can look for remote gigs like <a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelList</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn Jobs</a>, <a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteOK</a>, <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WeWorkRemotely</a>, <a href="http://yunojuno.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YunoJuno</a>, <a href="https://jobspresso.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobspresso</a> and <a href="https://www.airtasker.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airtasker</a>, just to name a few. Take a look at these job postings. If you don’t yet have the skills to qualify, go out and get them!
