<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first-ever CodingNomads </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python bootcamp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Barcelona has come to a close, and was a celebration of coding, community, and Catalunya! Led by instructors from Austria and the US, we graced Barcelona with the presence of our students from the US, Holland, Saudi Arabia, and an Estonian-turned-local-Barcelonian.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Together we conquered hiking paths along the coast and countryside, dipped into the Balearic sea, dined on Friday tapas (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“just... just keep bringing more food!!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), participated in the local stand-up comedy scene, and spent hours programming - both during and outside of class times! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue reading to learn about our Python bootcamp, student outcomes, projects built, and our fun weekend adventures in Barcelona!</span>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"CodingNomads personalized support is unmatched! I went there to learn to code, which I did, but during that time I also gained a group of friends that I plan on staying in contact with forever." —</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick V.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">About our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python bootcamp</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Python coding bootcamp was 12 weeks long, including 2 weeks of online preparation, 6 weeks of intense daily coding in Barcelona, and a final 4 weeks of building out projects online. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our students learned Python programming from scratch, Django, API development, SQL, AWS and more, so they could build and deploy full-scale web applications.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although our Python course focused on Backend Web Development, we took a couple of excursions into the realms of data science and analysis using pandas, jupyter labs and other technologies. Our students join our coding bootcamps with interests across the board, so we build flexibility in our class structure to support students going forward in varying directions. </span>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I just finished the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python Bootcamp</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> in Barcelona and highly recommend CodingNomads. As an experienced data analyst, I figured Python was a good next step towards data science (plus I wanted to travel!) - now I feel confident this was the right step for me!"</em> —Laura V.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python for beginners</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that once you get the hang of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programming language, learning another one is much easier! So we make sure to get the core computer science basics right, going over lots of coding exercises and diving deep into the language whenever our inquisitive students wanted to know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait...but why?!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9734" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image9.jpg" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="650" />
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIs, SQL and Django</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Python fundamentals, we started to work with APIs. Our students learned to harvest data from platforms such as Twitter for use in services they wanted to build themselves. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we took off learning SQL - a very widely used technology for interacting with databases - as well as how to integrate it with our Python code.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We learned to use Python’s most popular web framework Django, for building production-quality webapps. We also learned how to use Django REST Framework to build APIs. Finally, we used multiple services on AWS (Amazon Web Services) to deploy our webapps and interact with a remote server environment.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9733" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image8.png" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="477" />
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student goals &amp; outcomes</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our students came to our course with a wide variety of goals, yet unified through the serious wish to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn Python programming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some wanted to get a good basic understanding of programming in order to be able to learn any other language, and build products by themselves. Some came to fulfill a lifelong wish to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn Python</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others found themselves at a crossroads, deciding between taking their professional lives into a new direction, improving their current job positions with tech skills, or building the necessary skills and network to find well-paid remote work opportunities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything that’s worth something in life requires hard work, and attending a bootcamp is only the start of a challenging but rewarding path to becoming a programmer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we were very proud to see our students take great leaps forward, and quickly too. Within just a few weeks of the course ending, one student already got an internship at an AI company working with big data and APIs - pretty sweet! </span>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am left in awe of the fact that I am actually now capable of building the complex trading platform I have set out to do. Not only that, but I have a bunch of new friends that you would normally only get after spending years together in college.” </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Rasmus G.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Python projects for beginners and beyond</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our students built a flurry of projects during the bootcamp, some of which are large-scale and still ongoing! Some students dove into full-stack web development with Bootstrap and CSS to build out their portfolio pages. Others created new products through various API integrations. Some worked with interesting datasets to analyze and report about female unemployment in developing countries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are other examples to take a closer look:</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto-Signal</span></h3>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/lauramayol/crypto_signal</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our students Laura built an API using Django that gives cryptocurrency buy and sell suggestions by analyzing Google Trends search results and historical Bitcoin prices.. She also created a Tableau visualization to show her algorithm’s performance. Even as she was just building out the concept, her project made it on the </span><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-crowdsourced-bitcoin-price-prediction-algorithm-b49541c77afe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">front page of Hackernoon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another student has been diligently working on fulfilling his dream of creating a functioning cryptocurrency trading bot. He’s gone to impressive lengths by building out a solid database and well-structured, reusable code. The screenshot below shows his database design as mentioned in </span><a href="https://medium.com/@bliiir/postgres-table-merge-using-a-triple-composite-key-f99874b073bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a tutorial he wrote on Medium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn Python programming?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is a great language for getting started with programming. It reads almost like English, or pseudocode, which helps humans (rather than machines) easily read it.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9728" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image3.jpg" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="644" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get your feet wet with programming, Python is a great choice. It’s a language that enables you to build full-production products, and apply to a variety of well-paid job positions. Successful Python students can future-proof your job opportunities, and as an added bonus, have fun building exciting projects throughout the process!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python scales incredibly well and is diverse in its application. With Python, you can do anything. You can build production scale webapps like Instagram, write scripts to automate workflows on your computer, and dive into data science and machine learning. Largely driven by data science and machine learning, Python has been the fastest growing language for years. It’s a pace that is likely to continue. </span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python bootcamp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience in Barcelona</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living in Barcelona</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Barcelona is a city with a beautifully relaxed and joyful feeling. Simply strolling through the streets or sitting at a lively plaza makes for an uplifting and relaxing experience, taking in the sounds of people chatting over tapas, and children roaming in groups.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our CodingNomads group spent most our time in the Gracia neighborhood, where our co-working space Betahaus had lovely views from their café terrace! We often enjoyed good conversations on hikes in Barcelona’s famous Parc Güell, just around the corner from Betahaus. A few of us decided to expand on the bootcamp idea and challenge our bodies in addition to our minds with daily CrossFit classes spoken en español! </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9735" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image10.jpg" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="293" />
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the Barcelona comedy scene</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our students Kadri is an Estonian living in Barcelona. Showing us around like a local, she invited us to her stand-up comedy shows, which quickly became one of our weekend meeting spots. Even our US student Tony got on stage to perform...</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9738" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image13.png" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="623" />

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those Barcelona views</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Barcelona also boasts a couple of beautiful hills that were easily accessible from our neighborhood. So it isn’t a shocker that we frequently spoiled ourselves with beautiful views across the city we were getting to know and love during our time there.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9726" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image1.jpg" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="611" />
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekend trip to Palamós</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because life can’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be coding, and we were right on the beautiful Mediterranean coast, we rented a car and took a weekend trip up North to Palamós. Hiking along the beautiful and rugged coastline rewarded us with some amazing views! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being out and about in nature is also a great way of getting to know each other from a different perspective. We had fun exploring pretty beaches, talking up dogs in Estonian, and  sharing some chips and cava while swimming at our own private beach in the crystal clear sea.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On our way back, we stopped for some patatas bravas and mounted the final hills to our car with the setting sun in the horizon.</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekend trip to Montserrat</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one of our weekend trips took us to the famous monastery of Montserrat. Yes, there’s a cable car going up the mountain, but of course, our hiking-fanatic group wanted to surmount that challenge by foot. And what a good choice it was to do so! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The hike uphill gave us great views over the unique cliffs in the area. Montserrat itself is quite lively with tourists, and seeing the ancient buildings and views was a good experience well worth the hike!</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9740" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image15.jpg" alt="learn-python-programming" width="970" height="704" />
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coding bootcamp for the books</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, it was an honor to work with our first CodingNomads Python bootcamp in Barcelona.  Everyone added a unique piece to this beautiful puzzle. It was rewarding to help such motivated, smart, interesting, and lovely people take their steps into the world of Python programming, and become a close group of friends! We’re excited to stay contact, and see where their paths will lead them.</span>
