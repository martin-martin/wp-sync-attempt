Let's recap that in writing. First and foremost: <em>The web is a mess</em>. You'll want to use a web framework because it <em>simplifies web development</em>. More specifically, it helps you to:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Automate</strong> repetitive web development tasks</li>
 	<li><strong>Abstract</strong> database interactions</li>
 	<li><strong>Handle</strong> URL requests and URL mapping</li>
 	<li><strong>Provide</strong> templating frameworks</li>
 	<li><strong>Help</strong> with security, caching, sessions, etc.</li>
</ul>
In this post you learned about what web frameworks are and why they are useful for web development. In the next post, you will learn about why <em>Django</em> is a great choice for a Python web framework.
