<h3>1. Python for data science</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first - and perhaps today's most talked about use of Python - is in data science. Data science is the practice of extracting information and insight from data. In this case, data science includes machine learning, data visualization and data analysis.</span>
<a id="PyML"></a>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python for machine learning</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning (ML) is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) where machines learn from programs without being explicitly programmed to do so. In essence, machine learning enables computers to program themselves. Examples of ML algorithms include:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recommender systems - for example, when Netflix or Youtube makes recommendations based on your watch history.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image recognition systems - for example, that can recognize whether an image is a cat or dog, the popular </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Hotdog app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the TV series Silicon Valley, or </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT208108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FaceID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Apple that recognizes you unlocks your phone.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10982" src="http://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MachineLearningGraphic.png" alt="python for machine learning, what is machine learning" width="800" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source: </span><a href="http://codingnomads.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodingNomads</span></a></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Python for machine learning</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its early days, Python has been used for scientific and numerical computing. Because machine learning is mainly numerical computation, Python is extremely useful for ML. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially with the introduction of </span><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tensorflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the largest end-to-end ML platform developed by Google, Python has become the de-facto language for ML applications. </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pytorch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another deep learning platform started by Facebook, is also gaining popularity. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Python comes with </span><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scikit-learn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a simple and easy to use ML package that can get you started very easily in Machine Learning. You can see the increase of popularity in these ML platforms in the graph below. </span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth of Python Machine Learning Libraries</span></h4>
<img class="size-full wp-image-10721 aligncenter" src="http://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PythonLibrariesSO2019.png" alt="learn Python, python programming, python bootcamp, what is Python used for" width="602" height="407" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source: </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=tensorflow%2Cscikit-learn%2Cpytorch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Trends</span></a></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python for data visualization and data analysis</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rapid growth of the Internet, we are creating more data than ever. A recent </span><a href="https://www.domo.com/solution/data-never-sleeps-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by DOMO states that over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every single day! That is a lot of data, and if used wisely, can help businesses make effective decisions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Data visualization is an easy way to look at large amounts of data and understand the patterns in the data. An interesting example of how data visualization can help people better understand data is the below chart drawn by Florence Nightingale about the causes of death in the hospital during the Crimean War. Rather than just showing a table with numbers, visually depicting the data makes it more meaningful and impactful.</span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Visualization Created by Florence Nightingale</span></h4>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-10964" src="http://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nightingale_data_visualization.jpg" alt="data visualization by nightingale " width="480" height="315" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source: </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/deloitte-review/issue-12/telling-a-story-with-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte</span></a></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Libraries like </span><a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matplotlib</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seaborn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make visualization super easy. With just a few lines of code, you can plot bar graphs, heat maps or distributions of the data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In data analysis, you use the visualizations of data, along with other parameters like mean, median and mode, to understand the data and make decisions based on it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding and presenting data to drive business decisions can save significant costs. For example, Netflix uses data visualizations to understand what factors help subscribers stay subscribed. By incorporating these findings into their personalization and recommendation engines, </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2843948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix saves $1B per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizations using seaborn</span></h4>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Python for web development</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development includes all the activities used to create websites and web-based software applications. There are two parts to every website - the client side, which runs code on the internet browser of a user’s computer; and the server side, where the code runs on the web server. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, JavaScript is a client-side language that runs on the browser, and enables user interaction on a website. Alternatively, Python runs on the server, and is responsible for processing the logic behind user inputs, interacting with databases and other servers, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python developers can use web frameworks to quickly and efficiently build dynamic web applications without having to learn a client-side language like JavaScript. Frameworks significantly reduce development time by automating common web development tasks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python has two major server side frameworks - Django and Flask (which is a micro-framework). Python also has inbuilt modules that help deal with JSON, sockets, http-requests and more, making the process of web development seamless.</span>
<a id="PyApp"></a>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Python for application development</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Python is written to have lower development time and effort, it is great for prototyping. Because of its robustness, scalability, speed, and versatility, Python is also great for enterprise-scale projects. </span><a href="https://enlyft.com/tech/products/python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iDataLabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 69% of companies that use Python are small (&lt;$50M in revenue), 9% are medium-sized ($50M – $1000M in revenue) and 16% are large (&gt;$1000M in revenue).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python also comes with a database API, which allows easy connection to databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, etc. Python’s interfacing to languages like C and Java via </span><a href="https://cython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cython</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.jython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jython</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also allows developers to easily bring functionality from other languages into a Python application.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python comes with PyPi, a huge collection of Python packages that can be used to quickly implement any functionality that you may need in your project. Thus, building a large application in Python is similar to using legos to create a new structure! Use the blocks carefully and join them together in the right way to create your masterpiece today. Can’t find a package you need? Because Python is open source, you can create a new package that solves your problem and share it with the world!</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Python for automation scripts</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest use case for Python is in scripting. Scripting means writing small programs that perform a certain task automatically. Python is ideal for this as it was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invented</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be quick and easy to write. The book </span><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Al Sweigart, teaches you to create simple scripts with Python to perform tasks that would take you hours if done manually.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example of a script is web scraping - parsing a website and extracting relevant information out of it. Libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup make it super easy to parse through a web page and capture the relevant information. Then this information can be stored in a format like CSV, which can then be fed into a machine learning algorithm to make any awesome predictions or recommendations that you seek. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can use Python to scrape the </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Weather Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website to get the weather data for San Francisco, which you can then feed into a machine learning algorithm to predict the weather. So cool! </span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Python in Finance</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial technology (fintech) is technology that automates and improves the delivery and use of financial services - from your online banking portal to blockchain applications. Fintech is used across sectors such as investment and portfolio management, banking, education, and fundraising. According to </span><a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HackerRank’s 2018 Developer Skills Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Python is among the top three most popular languages used in financial services companies, and the top language in FinTech.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-10970" src="http://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/python_fintech_finance.png" alt="python for fintech, python for finance" width="750" height="509" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Source: </span><a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/emerging-languages-still-overshadowed-by-incumbents-java-python-in-coding-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackerrank</span></a></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech requires applications that are robust, secure, compliant, and easy-to-use. To give you an idea of the market size and opportunity, in 2018 </span><a href="https://www.consultancy.eu/news/2390/global-fintech-investment-more-than-doubled-to-112-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$112 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was invested into companies that are innovating in the fintech space. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python, with its ease of use, modularity and mathematical base, fits right into fintech. Python modules like pyalgotrade (for algorithm trading), scipy (for scientific computing) and quantecon.py (for quantitative economics) provide solid building blocks for developing fintech applications. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is also ideal for fintech because of its machine learning and data science libraries and capabilities. For example, using machine learning to automatically detect fraud using payment history could potentially save a company millions of dollars. It is no wonder that companies like Stripe, Robinhood and Revolut use Python in</span> <a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/9-fintech-companies-that-use-python-in-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their software development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
