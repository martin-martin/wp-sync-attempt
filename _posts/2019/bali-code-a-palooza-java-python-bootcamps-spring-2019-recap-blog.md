<blockquote>‚ÄúObviously, learning how to code in a paradise like Bali is pretty cool. But additional to that, for me being out of my daily environment really helped me stay focused...They set the right expectations, help you get settled in and are very much open for feedback. They will do anything in their power to make this the best possible experience for you.‚Äù Robert L. Python-Bali 2019.</blockquote>

<h2>About our Python bootcamp</h2>
Our 16 week Python course starts with 8 weeks online learning Python, SQL and APIs. Then 4 intensive weeks in Bali, learning frameworks like Django / Flask, servers &amp; deployment, machine learning fundamentals, etc. It‚Äôs a lot of information in just a little time, so we focus on setting a strong foundation for learning other languages / techs thereafter.

We also focus on having fun when coding into the night, complete with disco lights - ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs how we roll.

<h3>Why Learn Python programming?</h3>
Our students have varying objectives for learning Python - to automate tasks at work, oversee product or engineering teams, build your own stuff, or develop skills to become a digital nomad.

Python is considered one of the easier programming languages to read, write and learn, which is great for beginners and/or experienced coders to start building projects fast.

With Python uses in machine learning, data science, blockchain, fintech, web development, etc., it‚Äôs the fastest growing programming language. Just see how Python‚Äôs StackOverflow queries compare to other languages below.

<h2><a id="AboutJava"></a>About our Java bootcamp</h2>
Our 16 week Java coding bootcamp teaches a comprehensive package of skills that are in demand for tens of thousands of jobs worldwide. Tech skills gained include Java, the Spring Framework, RESTful API development, MVC development, SQL, Amazon Web Services (AWS), security, shell scripting, deployment, scalability, Git, Jira, and much more.

In all our bootcamps we also have guest lectures - like Cristian's discussion on Agile Development below - so students can learn and share knowledge gained from the field.

<h3>Why Learn Java programming?</h3>
Java is an excellent first programming language to learn because it‚Äôs used widely across all industry sectors worldwide. Once you know Java, learning another programming language like Python or C will be much easier because of the structure Java instills.

Year after year Java is the #1 most in-demand programming language for jobs in the US and Europe. Yet <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2018-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research">only 9% of coding bootcamps teach Java</a>. We‚Äôre proud to be one of the few and fearless Java bootcamps, preparing students with future-proof skills they can apply to a job in engineering, management, entrepreneurship and more.

<h2><a id="Outcomes"></a>Student goals &amp; outcomes</h2>
Our students come from all walks of life, with varied goals for learning to code. Our Bali grads have gone on to jobs such as Project Manager, Product Owner, Data Engineer, Strategy &amp; Operations Manager and more.

One grad was awarded a scholarship to study Data Science in Boston (hooray!), another started an online business (bravo!). Some students continued to travel the world, and the rest are hitting the pavement to find work.

It can take months to land a great engineering job, between building out portfolio projects and interviewing. We‚Äôre very proud of the progress so far, and excited to see continued student success in the great wide world of technology!

<h3></h3>
<h3><a id="companytraining"></a>Company-sponsored training</h3>
More and more of our students attend with the support of their companies, and return to work after the course. Great employees aren‚Äôt always easy to find, and finding great engineers can be even harder. The cost of recruiting, interviewing, training, etc. can add up to <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/it-costs-50k-to-hire-a-software-engineer-d06a0d051abf">tens of thousands of dollars</a>, while our coding bootcamps cost a fraction of that.

If coding skills could benefit your role, and you have a genuine interest to learn to code, your company may find it a better investment to train you instead of hiring externally. And training in a place like Bali - talk about building employee loyalty!

Whether or not your company foots the bill, if learning engineering skills benefits your current job role, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc513">your training also may be tax deductible</a>. All the wins.
<blockquote>‚ÄúThe knowledge I gained during the course today helped me to move into a Product Owner role. It allows me to dive one level deeper into roadmap and refinement discussions working with the architects and team.‚Äù Arno K., Product Owner at Philips.</blockquote>

<h2><a id="projects"></a>Coding bootcamp projects</h2>
Our students worked on a variety of projects during the bootcamp, from web applications, to blockchain, to smart watch apps. Below are some highlights:
<h3>Travel to Share</h3>
World travel often introduces you to people with different insight and knowledge. Travel to Share is a free web application that connects travelers and locals to share experiences, stories and skills in free workshops and events.

Built primarily in Python and Django, it also uses JavaScript, CSS, HTML, BOOTSTRAP4, awesome font, and Digital Ocean Droplet deployment. The site uses several free API keys to gather and display visa info, weather, country information, maps, contact forms and more.

&nbsp;
<h3>Construction Site Data Logging Application</h3>
One of our students came with a specific project in mind, and built it by the end of the course. Count &amp; Cooper construction firm in The Netherlands needed a better way to track the disruptions to road users caused during construction projects. Previously using a laborious spreadsheet, this web app provides a straight-forward and effective tool for the job.

Built using Python, Django, AWS, SQL and various other technologies taught in class, it also uses the Python Pandas library to perform mathematical logic. Still in its infancy, this app will soon incorporate technology for data visualization, and integrate with third party APIs.

&nbsp;
<h3>Betty</h3>
This project was a doozy of a backend job, and combined student interests in sports betting, risk, finance, trading, data, machine learning, and automation.

Betty is a web application that analyzes real-time sports reporting and social media sentiment to make betting recommendations. It collects match information, bet odds and Tweets about teams from the Matchbook and Twitter APIs. Tweets are analyzed using Stanford CoreNLP sentiment analysis, and all this information combined informs a buy or sell recommendation.

Techs used include Java, Spring &amp; Spring Batch, Gradle, Travis, Twitter API, Matchbook API, Twitter4j Library, Standford CoreNLP library, AWS EC2, Amazon RDS, MySQL, Continuous Integration &amp; Continuous Deployment, GitHub, SonarCloud, and some HTML /CSS.

All on the backend, feast your eyes on that beautiful code below!

<h2><a id="experience"></a>The Bali coding bootcamp experience</h2>
Bali is a great course location for so many reasons. Our coworking space Outpost gives students a productive and inspiring environment to learn. Ubud, Bali is a lovely place to live, with great accommodations, delicious and affordable food, and lots of fun to be had on the weekends. Below are some of the highlights from our trip!

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CNBali19_templeJump_blog.jpg" alt="digital nomad, Python bootcamp, coding bootcamp, learn to code, coding bootcamp bali, learn to code bali, learn python, learn java, java bootcamp" width="576" height="391" />
<h3>Exercising our minds and bodies</h3>
Our coding bootcamps are intense, so we‚Äôre big proponents of exercising our bodies to fuel our minds and spirits. We dove into Ubud‚Äôs yoga and fitness scene, getting our sweat on with hot yoga, sound healing, hang-from-the-ceiling, breathwork - we tried it all.

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MartinHangingBali-800px.jpg" alt="learn to code bali" width="576" height="432" />
<h3>Exploring the island</h3>
On the weekends we conquered the island by van, scooters, white water rafts, motorcycles, boats, Gojeks, and by foot. We particularly enjoyed exploring on geocaching field trips - using the GPS on our phones to find small boxes filled with surprises left by other geocachers. Like a never-ending treasure hunt with unknown friends around the world. See that box up there? :)

&nbsp;

We hiked and biked up the Mount Batur volcano at sunrise. We meandered through the rice fields on the Campuhan Ridge Walk. We traversed between waterfalls in the mountains to the north. We can say without a doubt - we loved our time on Bali!

<h3></h3>
<h3>And that crazy rafting trip...</h3>
It started with a fun van ride, everyone piled in. As soon as we finally started down the river, we had to stop, get out, and wait to change rafts. Then we rafted down spillways, bumped into every rock and canyon wall, and also saw a helicopter camera crew with elephants in the jungle (?!). It was a wild ride in an incredibly beautiful setting, and so much fun. Made the bump-bump worth it.

<h3></h3>
<h3>Weekend trip to Nusa Penida &amp; Lebongan</h3>
Here we had the boat trip of a lifetime (üòâ), snorkeled with manta rays, did some extreme hiking to a pristine freshwater pool by the sea, and of course, played lots of Exploding Kittens. We also had a special guest appearance by Kadri - a graduate from our 2018 Barcelona Python bootcamp. It's so fun to have alumni visit us on the road!

<h3></h3>
<h3>Plus a healthy dose of karaoke</h3>
Pool party got rained out? No problem. We made our own parties where everyone is the star. We even sang in each student‚Äôs language for the full multicultural experience :)

[gallery columns="2" link="none" size="400" ids="10878,10879"]
<h3></h3>
<h3><a id="hangouts"></a>After the bootcamp: RISE conference and global hangouts</h3>
The crew was not quite done hanging out after Bali. The fun continued with CodingNomads meet ups in Singapore, Amsterdam, Turkey, and the RISE conference in Hong Kong. It's always a bummer to say goodbye. But we know that even as time passes, we stay connected by this shared experience, and look forward to seeing each other again sometime, somewhere!

<h2>Not your average coding bootcamp</h2>
We do things a bit differently at CodingNomads, and we like it that way.
