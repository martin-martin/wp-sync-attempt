<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone is talking about Python, and for good reason. With an exponentially growing community around data science, machine learning, AI, web dev and more, Python is a language that opens programming access to the world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the realm of server side software languages, Python is considered easy to read, write and learn. Plus, it's extremely scalable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world's largest companies run on it, and it's also great for quick and simple prototypes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The list goes on for why we think it’s a good idea to learn Python programming, whether you’re new to coding or an experienced dev. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 6 major reasons why.</span>
<h2>First, what is Python programming?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is a high-level programming language used for general-purpose software engineering. It's a server side language - which means it runs on the server, and is responsible for processing the logic behind user inputs, interacting with databases and other servers, etc. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially developed in the late 1980’s by Guido Van Rossum, Python has been around for decades alongside other server side languages like Java and C. Van Rossum modeled Python after the English language, eliminating unnecessary syntax to make it easier to read and write than other programming languages. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is an open-sourced language like Java (our other fave programming language), and in recent years has increased in popularity due to its use in data science. Python also has a strong community around machine learning, data modeling, data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), with extensive resources and libraries built for these purposes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And yes, the rumors are true. Python is named after the British comedy group Monty Python. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed if you decide to learn Python, you shall code with the strength of many men, Sir Knight.</span>

<h2></h2>
<h2>So why should you learn Python?</h2>
<h3>1. Python is versatile</h3>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Python used for?</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to name a few, Python is used in Data Mining, Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Web Development, Web Frameworks, Embedded Systems, Graphic Design applications, Gaming, Network development, Product development, Rapid Application Development, Testing, Automation, the list goes on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is used as an easier and more efficiently-written alternative to languages like C, R, and Java, and is growing in popularity as the primary language for many applications.</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python uses in data science</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the R programming language is most commonly used for data science, with a rich ecosystem of libraries for statistical analysis. As Python code is considered easier to maintain and more scalable than R, Python has increased in popularity for data science - especially among professionals without advanced education in statistics or mathematical fields. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, many packages have been developed for data analysis and machine learning using Python. This includes numpy and pandas, which allow users to understand and transform data; tensorflow, which is used to code machine learning algorithms; and pyspark, an API for working with Spark - a framework for easily working with large data sets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These libraries enable your every day web developer to analyze large data trends, without having to learn the ins and outs of the more complex R.</span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Growth of Libraries written in Python</strong></h4>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of companies use Python?</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is great for quick prototyping, hence is used extensively by startups to build their first minimum viable product (MVP). As a highly scalable language, Python is also used in large companies. In a recent blog post, </span><a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/python-at-netflix-bba45dae649e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussed its uses of Python in everything from their Content Delivery Network (CDN)  to their monitoring systems. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also loves Python programming for its solutions. Peter Norvig, director of research at Google, </span><a href="https://www.python.org/about/quotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language.</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://enlyft.com/tech/products/python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iDataLabs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 69% of the companies that use Python are small (&lt;$50M in revenue), 9% are medium-sized ($50M - $1000M in revenue) and 16% are large (&gt;$1000M in revenue). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how can you maximize the number of industries that would be open to hiring you? Choose a language that is used across the board. Whether you want to work for Google building their next worldwide application or for Pixar to help produce their next feature film, Python opens the doors to any industry.</span>

<h3>3. Python tops the list of the most in-demand programming languages</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Going hand-in-hand with lightning speed growth, Python programming is in high demand for jobs. Based on the number of job postings on one of the largest job search platforms, Indeed.com, we compiled the top ten in-demand programming languages of 2019.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While these statistics only reflect US Markets, Python is in demand worldwide. However, </span><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2018-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 9% of coding bootcamps teach Python or Java</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are proud to be one of the fearless few that teach these badass, in-demand programming languages!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth noting that this graph does not include SQL, since it is a database query language and not a programming language. SQL boasts <a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-sql-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">102,416 job listings</a> on Indeed.com, showing that it is one of the most useful skills for a software developer to have. With our curriculum teaching both Python and SQL, our goal is to ensure you have the skills required to succeed in today’s demanding job market.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-9944" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TopLanguagesGraph_2019.png" alt="top programming languages, best programming language, most in-demand programming language" width="500" height="500" />
<h3>4. Python is easy to read, write, and learn</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python was built with the goal of getting rid of the complex and keeping only the necessary. Because of this, Python is easy to read, write, and most importantly, learn</span>

<a href="https://wpengine.com/developers-feel-programming-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WP Engine surveyed 909 developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the US on which programming language is the easiest to learn. Python came in second place after HTML, and was noted for its “high readability and simple syntax that is easy to learn.” The article also states that, “for new coders especially, the consistency and simplicity of Python both contribute to its ease of use and approachability.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be discouraging for new programmers to sift through all the necessary syntax of other languages before they can perform their first simple task. With Python, your first “Hello World!” application is only a line away, unlike the 4 or 5 lines needed for other programming languages. Python’s efficient syntax allows programmers to get up and running fast, and pack logic into compact scripts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Python is also an interpreted programming language. This means that unlike compiled languages like C++ or Java, you can run each line of code as soon as you finish writing it and see the results immediately. This is especially great for new programmers because you can get instantaneous feedback instead of waiting for the whole program to compile and run before you figure out that you forgot one character somewhere!</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it's no wonder that Python is the most loved programming language</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given Python’s popularity for its ease of reading and writing, it’s no wonder that it was named </span><a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackerrank’s most loved programming language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Python even remained the leader across all age groups, despite the tendency for younger generations to prefer different languages than older generations of programmers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, professional software engineers make up only a fraction of the total population of coders. People of all ages and careers are showing interest in programming because of its usefulness across many industries and professions, combined with the accessibility of learning tools. Especially for hobby coders, or professionals who simply need an easier way to automate tasks or analyze data, Python is the most beloved choice.</span>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Most Loved Programming Languages of 2018</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10737" src="https://codingnomads.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Python_Loved_Language_Hackerrank_Graph.png" alt="" width="1000" height="467" /></p>
