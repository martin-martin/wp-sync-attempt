<ul>

</ul>
</li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While enrolled in CodingNomads mentorship program, student will have weekly scheduled 1:1 mentor meetings.

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodingNomads reserves the right to postpone, relocate or change any of the mentor sessions in the case of unforeseen events or medical emergencies. In these unlikely cases we will communicate changes directly via email with students.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PAYMENTS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payments will be processed in United States Dollars. </span><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Billing. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use a third-party payment processor (the &quot;Payment Processor&quot;) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your &quot;Billing Account&quot;) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your &quot;Payment Method&quot;). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</span></p>
<p><b>Payment Method. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</span></p>
<p><b>Recurring Billing. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. We may submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (receipt of which is confirmed by us) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before we reasonably could act. To terminate your authorization or change your payment method, please contact your account representative or email CodingNomads at kim.desmond@codingnomads.co.</span></p>
<p><b>Current Information Required. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For recurring payments,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account. You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our payment processor if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made by contacting your account representative or emailing kim.desmond@codingnomads.co. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of paid services under your billing account unless you have terminated your paid services as set forth above.</span></p>
<p><b>Change in Amount Authorized. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</span></p>
<p><b>Auto-Renewal for Subscription Services. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done by contacting your account representative or emailing kim.desmond@codingnomads.co, any Subscription Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Subscription Services at any time, contact your account representative or email kim.desmond@codingnomads.co. </span><b>If you terminate a Subscription Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ADMISSION / ELIGIBILITY / EXPULSION</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A student’s registration will not be valid until receipt and clearance of payment by CodingNomads. A confirmation and payment receipt will be sent by email once CodingNomads has received the fully completed application form and the related payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodingNomads reserves the right in their sole discretion to accept, decline to accept, or remove any participant from a CodingNomads course at any time during the course period. CodingNomads reserves the right, without penalty, to make changes in the published itinerary whenever, in their judgment, conditions warrant or if they deem it necessary for the comfort, convenience, or safety of participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By registering for a CodingNomads course, the participant certifies that he/she does not have any mental, physical, or other condition or disability that would create a hazard for him/herself or other participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to expel any participant for any reason, including, but not limited to: lack of payment; inability to complete coursework assignments on time; if deemed necessary for the comfort, convenience or safety of the other participants, including if your behavior is deemed to cause or be likely to cause danger, distress or annoyance to other participants; if we reasonably determine your condition would adversely affect your health, safety or enjoyment of that of other participants; if we determine you have engaged in illegal actions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is our policy to assist participants with keeping up with coursework through instructor check-ins and personalized assistance. However if the participant demonstrates repeated inability to complete coursework assignments on time, we reserve the right to remove you from the course. If we must remove you from a course in progress due to inability to complete coursework assignments on time, your tuition will be refunded at a pro-rated amount, minus a cancellation fee of 10% of the full course cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we remove you from a course in progress for any other reason, you will not be entitled to any refund, payment, compensation or credit of any kind for unused or missed services or costs incurred resulting from the termination of your participation. In the case of expulsion, you will be responsible for the course fees.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CANCELLATION POLICY</b></p>

Students who enroll in, and pre-pay for, multiple months of an intensive mentored program may request a refund for the additional months paid for after the current month when the cancellation was made.
