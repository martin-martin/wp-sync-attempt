&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CodingNomads LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates https://codingnomads.co (the "Site"), which uses cookies. By using the Site, you consent to the use of cookies.

Our Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how third-parties we may partner with may use cookies on the Site, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies. For additional information on our Privacy Policy, please visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://codingnomads.co/privacy-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy page</a>.

<h2>What are cookies</h2>

Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you.

&nbsp;
<h2>How we use Cookies</h2>

We use cookies for the following purposes: to provide analytics, to store your preferences, to enable advertisements delivery, including behavioral advertising.
&nbsp;

We use third party services such as Mailchimp, Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Facebook Conversion Tracker, Hubspot and SalesHandy, that monitor our site usage, collect IP addresses, send marketing emails, and advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. This includes advertising to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example filling out a contact form. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.  Third-party vendors, including Mailchimp and Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the CodingNomads website. We use Mailchimp and Hubspot marketing platforms to store Personal Information for sales and marketing outreach activities.
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own <a target="_blank" href="https://codingnomads.co/privacy-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s privacy policy</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">Mailchimp's privacy policy</a>, and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/">Mailchimp's Terms</a>.</span>
&nbsp;

<h4>Cookies in email</h4>
We automatically place single pixel gifs, also known as web beacons, in most emails that we send. These are tiny graphic files that contain unique identifiers that enable us to recognize when subscribers have opened an email or clicked certain links. These technologies record each subscribers email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click for a campaign. We use this data to create reports for our users about how an email campaign performed and what actions subscribers took.
&nbsp;

<h4>Cookies in remarketing</h4>
CodingNomads usesMailChimp, Google and Facebook remarketing ads (also known as web retargeting ads) to create and manage advertisements on the Google and Facebook Display Networks. When a user visits our site, we install a tracking pixel on our Site through the Snippet. The Snippet also allows our Site to set a MailChimp, Google and/or Facebook cookie that will recognize Site visitors via ads placed with the Google or Facebook remarketing ads feature. These technologies facilitate the placement of advertising campaigns on the Google Display Network and enableMailChimp, Google and/or Facebook to provide reporting to our users about the performance of these advertising campaigns.
&nbsp;

<h2>Your choices regarding cookies</h2>
You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You may refrain from providing, or withdraw, your consent for cookies.

&nbsp;
<strong>Browser Controls:</strong> Your browser’s help function should contain instructions on how to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site, though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.
&nbsp;
<strong>Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:</strong> Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.
&nbsp;
<strong>Mobile Advertising:</strong> You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of Interest Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions. If you opt out, we will remove all data about you and no further data collection or tracking will occur. The random ID we (or our third party partners) had previously assigned to you will also be removed. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will not be able to continue and track you using the same ID as before, and you will for all practical purposes be a new user to our system.
&nbsp;
<strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. MailChimp takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">All About Do Not Track</a>.
