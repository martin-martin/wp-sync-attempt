<h1>Become a CodingNomads Mentor</h1>

Welcome! We're thrilled that you are interested in becoming a Mentor for CodingNomads. Below is a short description what mentorship means to us at CodingNomads, and what we look for in an ideal mentor. If you're interested and want to know more, check out our <a href="https://codingnomads.github.io/mentor-docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mentor Docs</a> and <a href="#apply">submit your interest below</a>.

<h2>What Mentorship Means To Us</h2>

<strong>Individuality</strong>: At CodingNomads, mentorship means that we care for our students as the individual person they are, and that we try our best to help students have an enjoyable, productive and meaningful learning process.

<strong>Skills</strong>: As a great mentor, you know the course material well and you know how to efficiently find solutions which you don't yet have. One important lesson is to help your students to learn how to figure challenges out by themselves. That means that you will already know the answer, but you don't tell the solution to your student directly. Instead, when and where possible, you guide them on the path of figuring it out themselves.

<strong>Care</strong>: In a nutshell, mentorship at CodingNomads is all about caring. When a student knows that they have a mentor who cares about their learning and their progress, it's a game changer. At CodingNomads, we want our mentors to be game changers.
