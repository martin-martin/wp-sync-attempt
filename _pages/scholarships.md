<h2>We are committed to making quality technical training available to you.</h2>

<h5>CodingNomads was born out of our desire to help people change their lives by learning to code. In addition to being one of the most affordable coding bootcamps on the market, we are very happy to offer the following coding bootcamp scholarships:</h5>
&nbsp;
<h4>Women in Tech Scholarship - $500 off onsite; 10% off online*</h4>
We are huge supporters of women in tech, as well as diversity in all workplaces. Women are vastly under represented across the industry, and we think it's time for that to change. We are very happy to offer scholarships to aspiring female software engineers.

&nbsp;
<h4>Military Scholarship - $500 off onsite; 10% off online*</h4>
Are you a veteran seeking career training? After all you've done for us, we'd love to help. CodingNomads offers several scholarships to active and retired military personnel. Please note that at this time, CodingNomads cannot accept GI Bill funding.

&nbsp;
<h4>Live the Dream Scholarship - up to $1000 off onsite bootcamps</h4>
This scholarship is intended for people who have the vision and have the motivation, but just lack the funds to get started. We've been there, and we get it. Tell us your story and why you're passionate about learning to code. This scholarship is awarded on a case by case basis and subject to availability.

&nbsp;
<h4>Local Resident Scholarship - up to $1000 off onsite tuition</h4>
CodingNomads is able to keep our tuition rates low in part by hosting our courses in affordable locations. So we want to give back. For qualified residents of our host countries, we are offering up to $1,000 off tuition. Please <a href="mailto:kim.desmond@codingnomads.co">get in touch with us</a> for details, and please spread the word!

&nbsp;
<h6><i>Please note, each student may only apply for one scholarship per course.</i></h6>
