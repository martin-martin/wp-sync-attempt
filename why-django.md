# Why Learn Django?

While there are many programming languages and even more web frameworks that can help you to achieve your goal of developing for the web, here are a couple of reasons why **Django** is a great choice:

Here's the recap in writing on why Django is a great choice for learning web development:

- **Community**: Django has a large, active, and welcoming community, which helps to find answers more quickly and stay engaged
- **Time- and battle-tested**: Django has been around and in use since 2005. There are many large projects that use the framework successfully and have done so for many years
- **Batteries included**: Django comes with everything you need already installed
- **Third-party packages**: If your project is special and you need something more specific than Django's batteries, there's a huge ecosystem of mature third-party packages to choose from
- **Pluggable Apps**: Django's structure relies on pluggable apps, which means that you can build an app for one project, and reuse it in another one
- **Django ORM**: You don't need to interact with your database using SQL but can instead use Django's in-built Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). This makes it possible to easily switch database backends without having to change your code
- **Python**: And, last but not least, Django is built in Python, your friendly neighborhood programming language that is easy to get started with and scales very well. It also has many applications ranging across data science, scripting, devops, web development into machine learning. It's a useful language, not just for web development
